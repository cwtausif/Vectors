##deployment

## Inspiration
Health care systems around the globe are facing extreme burden due to Covid-19 Virus so the idea is to manage our key healthcare resources efficiently by allocating and distributing the resources to manage the load on the healthcare system. there were few cases in Pakistan which surfaced to mainstream media that people died due to unavailability of ventilators, oxygen tanks which grasp our attention to address this issue that if in future our healthcare system is burdened (covid or post covid pandemic), there should be a centralised system to manage health resources (ventilators, beds, ICU's etc) effectively by distributing the load and in case of emergency an individual or ambulance services know where to take the patient which require specific services
## What it does
We built a web-based dashboard which shows the list of hospitals with the number of ventilators, isolation beds available, a patient can see the information where its required facilities are available, we have included limited functionality now we have restricted to covid-19 based resources and showing data of related to 1 city for now  but our idea is highly scalable we could add more health resources eg; Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU),blood-groups, Vaccine availabilities etc and we could add more hospitals in more regions
